        <strong>Adopting the DevOps Mindset:</strong
        ><em> ‚Äú Practical Exercises to Understand Azure Developers‚Äù</em>
      </h4>
      <p>
        This is a website/documentation directed specifically for cloud
        engineers to help them to understand all the topics and technologies
        required to adopt a cloud first mentality as a developer.
      </p>

      <h4>The why behind this project:</h4>
      <p>
        Among cloud engineers, there is a strong desire to serve better our
        customers which are often software developers. While our technical
        knowledge of cloud infrastructure and system admin skills suffice to
        solve most problems, there‚Äôs a lack of understanding on the specific
        circumstances and needs from the developer‚Äôs side. . That‚Äôs why I have
        created this website/documentation resource.
        <strong
          >To quickly help cloud engineers to understand the developer‚Äôs needs
          and circumstances by watching short videos and going through sample
          code file by looking for the specific technology they aim to
          understand </strong
        >. As opposed to go through lengthy online video courses which often do
        not include practical exercises or sample code.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Scope of this documentation, AKA <em>Who is this documentation for?</em>
      </h4>
      <p>
        This website is meant for
        <strong>Cloud Engineers/Former System/DBA admins</strong>, to quickly
        understand the needs of the AZ-204 developers that they‚Äôre serving, so
        that
        <strong
          >they can do their job with a better understanding on the impact and
          requirements that may arise in the future </strong
        >. It is in essence, a quick reference to upskill Cloud Engineers on
        specific technologies that Developers use in a ‚Äúas needed‚Äù based model
        to better serve our customers. The website is
        <strong
          >not intended to be a full compressive guide on how to become an
          AZ-204 Developer </strong
        >, although it may certainly be used as a useful aid. It‚Äôs primary
        purpose is to help Cloud Engineers to ‚ÄúPass‚Äù the understanding level
        needed to effectively communicate and serve AZ-204 developers that we
        work with.
      </p>
      <h4>Technologies used in this website:</h4>
      <p>
        The website is built using <strong>HTML5</strong> and
        <strong>Bootstrap</strong> which relies on <strong>CSS</strong> and
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> for responsiveness and aesthetics. All of
        the sample files such as demo <strong>NodeJS</strong> applications,
        <strong>Docker files, JSON, YAML, ARM templates</strong> as well as
        other code documents are stored in this repository:
        <a href="https://github.com/daviddelsol1998/Adopting-the-DevOps-Mindset"
          >Adopting-the-DevOps-Mindset on GitHub</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The website is hosted on <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> on the same
        repository, and it uses <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> for
        <strong>CI/CD</strong> processes. All the videos presented are hosted on
        YouTube under my personal YouTube channel as unlisted videos making them
        available only for website visitors with the link.
